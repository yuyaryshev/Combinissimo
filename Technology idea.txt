Technology idea

1)
	New research "pack" - "Circuits research pack"

	Arithmetic + Constant + Decider + Speaker => Logic Pack
	Copper Wire + Color wires + Power Switch => Wire Pack

	Logic Pack + 2 Wire Pack => Circuits research pack


2)
	New research process
	
	--------------------------------------
	- Special research process which involves player into creation of circuit setups.
		Need to give tasks (setups) for science pack production for of all typical circuit schemes
		- Counter
		- Sushi belt controller
		- Signal extraction?
		- Numeric display?
		- Gaudge display?
		
		- Best of all if this behavior is enforced by some complex recipes.
		- Maybe some special script for task area, may be implemented CPU intense if needed, since it won't be used in actual factory.
			
	- Maybe finding and fixing a bug in a small circuit scheme
	
	- There might be many more ideas. In fact it's kind of circuit mini campaign/tutorial

	--------------------------------------
	
	
The profit
	
3)
	The prize is great - unlocking "Combinissimo"
	
	- It allows making universal, UPS very friendly combinator which allows packing all the combinators into
		2x2 or 3x2 or 3x3 SINGLE entity.
		
	- It's implemented by making clone invisible and uncollidable entities of all vanilla like combinators.
		This entities are just placed over combonator entity and interconnected the same way they was in editor.
		
	- It's blueprint friendly - all the data is stored into main entity and the layout is recreated when entity is rebuilt.
	
	- It'll support instances - that is you can have same layout in many places. And if you have a mistake or change in it - 
		it will apply changes to all instances of this layout. 

	Logic Pack + 2 Wire Pack => 2x2 Combonator
	2 Logic Pack + 3 Wire Pack => 3x2 Combonator
	3 Logic Pack + 5 Wire Pack => 3x3 Combonator

4)
	There can be several tiers of research:
	- Different number of inputs in Combonator
	- Limits to number of combinators or size of Combinissimo editor
	- Marks for inputs
	- Special testing tools for circuits inside Combinissimo editor
	- Integration with wireless signals
	
	And, as a special cherry:
	- Slow* but dynamic changes to layout support
		*Implementing this will require "on_tick", so this "relayouts" will happen slowly, say one entity for one player per 10 ticks.
		If implemented so it will be UPS friendly.

I'm not sure if I will implement this all.
I don't have much time to work on this mod, but i do it from time-to-time.

If anyone want to be a leader of this mod - I'll be happy.
